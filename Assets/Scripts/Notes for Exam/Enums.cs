    ///  an enumeration type is a set, or collection, of named constants that belong to the same variable.

    /// They can store underlying types!
    /// underlying types for enumerations are limited to byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, and ulong. 
    /// These are called integral types, which are used to specify the size of numeric values that a variable can store.
