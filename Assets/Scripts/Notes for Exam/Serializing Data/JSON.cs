    /// <summary>
    /// JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is a human-readable text format made up of attribute-value pairs and arrays
    ///  JSON has a more diverse range of capabilities, specifically with database information and server communication with applications.
    /// The JSON data format is similar to XML, but without the tags. Instead, everything is based on attribute-value pairs
    ///  Each JSON document starts with a parent dictionary that holds as many attribute-value pairs as you need.
    /// Dictionaries use open and closed curly braces ( { } ), a colon separates each attribute and value, and each attribute-value pair is separated by a comma:
    /// </summary>

    // Parent dictionary for the entire file
    {
        // List of attribute-value pairs where you store your data
        "attribute_name": value,
        "attribute_name": value
    }

    //JSON can also have child or nested structures by setting the value of an attribute-value pair to an array of attribute-value pairs. 
    
    // Parent dictionary
    {
        // Weapon attribute with its value set to a child dictionary
        "weapon": {
            // Attribute-value pairs with weapon data
            "name": "Sword of Doom",
            "damage": 100
    }

    // Finally, JSON data is often made up of lists, or arrays, or objects. 
    // Continuing our example, if we wanted to store a list of all the weapons our player could choose, we would use a pair of square brackets to denote an array:

    // Parent dictionary
    {
        // List of weapon attributes set to an array of weapon objects
        "weapons": [
        // Each weapon object stored as its own dictionary
            {
                "name": "Sword of Doom",
                "damage": 100
            },
            {
                "name": "Butterfly knives",
                "damage": 25
            },
            {
                "name": "Brass Knuckles",
                "damage": 15
            }
        ]
    }
}
